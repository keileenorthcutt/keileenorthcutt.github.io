For my final project in Microcomputer Project Lab, I designed and implemented a "PC Gameboy." Essentially, I wanted to create a way to play original Gameboy cartridges on a PC using a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) controller for authentic gameplay using an existing emulator. Below is my project proposal for the system I built. This project involved creating a custom copper PCB as seen in the photo of my project below. By the end of the project, I was able to connect the NES controller to the PC as a valid game controller, dump the ROMs of my Gameboy cartridges into files on my PC, and play the cartridges on an emulator. The only part I wasn't able to complete was using the NES controller with the emulator. I ran into quite a few issues with interfacing with the PSoC.

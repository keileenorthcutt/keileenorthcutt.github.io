For my final project with a partner for Constructive Computer Architecture, I helped build upon the existing single-scalar processor infrastructure we were given to implement a more efficient cache and a superscalar system. We worked to run our design on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), but were unable to do so under the time constraints of our project. To read our paper on the project, click the link below.

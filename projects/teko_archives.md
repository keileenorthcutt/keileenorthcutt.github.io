As an undergraduate researcher in MIT's Digital Humanities Lab, I worked with Dr. Kanyinsola Obayan on the <a href="https://tekoarchives.com/">Tèkó Archives</a> website. During my time in the lab, I learned the basics of web development and archival research. The mission of the project is to bring to light the contributions of Lagos, Nigeria to personal computing.

    <h1 class="display-4">About Me</h1>

    <p>I was born and raised in Tullahoma, TN, and I have loved STEM most of my life. I credit my interest in electrical engineering and computer engineering (EECS) to my experience at Carnegie Mellon University's summer program for high school students (<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/pre-college/academic-programs/sams.html">Summer Academy for Math and Science</a>), which I was fortunate enough to attend in 2019 before my senior year of high school. There I was on the ECE project team, and getting to work on simple calculators and robots quickly made me realize that this is the stuff I wanted to spend my time doing.</p>

    <p>When I first started at MIT, I wasn't completely sure what path I wanted to take in EECS. I took classes in various subjects and worked as a researcher for the Digital Humanities Lab, learning and implementing both front and back-end components for informational, archival websites. Then, my sophomore year, I took Computation Structures, which focused primarily on basic computer processors. It was this class that really sparked my interest in hardware, and I went on to take as many hardware design classes as I could in the next few years. I felt like I was finally getting the answers to how things like televisions, laptops, and gaming consoles worked.p>

    <p>I was awarded the Dept. of Defense Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholarship in April 2022. As a part of this scholarship, I fulfilled a service commitment by interning and working full-time as a civilian electrical engineer at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. In this position, I aided in the maintenance and repair of multiple classes of rotating electrical machinery for Los Angeles and Virginia-class submarines. While the work I got to do in this position wasn't necessarily the part of EECS I'm passionate about, it was a great opportunity to get real experience with electrical testing, technical documentation, computer-aided design (CAD), and complex electrical systems.</p>

    <p>I'm now looking to start my career in hardware design. My passion for the subject is deeply rooted in my desire to help create new technologies that serve people for the better. I'm hoping to find a path to do this in the near future.</p>
